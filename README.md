# landing_page

Landing page project. Design and style a web page using what I've learned in HTML and CSS. Flexbox will be a primary component.

*EDIT*
Post completetion. Redid the CSS from 0 3 times, each time slightly tweaking a few things. Main issue was maintaining good looking design and readability when resizing the browser. Combining max widths with flex wraps was useful in ensuring items didn't overflow and look bad.
